backend => The brain + memory + rules of an application

for example -> 
Frontend: takes username + password
Backend: checks if user exist, check if password is correct
backend is not one thing,
APIs 
a doorway for the frontend to talk to the backend...

POST /login
POST /signup

B. Business Logic (the rules)

This is where thinking happens.

Examples:

Can a user cancel an order after 10 minutes?

Should discount apply or not?


C. Databases
Backend:

designs the database

talks to the database

protects the database

authentication & authorization ( secruity etc etc )

Performance ^ Scalability ( later stage )
